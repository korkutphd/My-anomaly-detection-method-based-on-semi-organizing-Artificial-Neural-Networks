# My-anomaly-detection-method-based-on-semi-organizing-maps-Artificial-Neural-Networks
This repository includes the anomaly detection method that I developed by combining the self-organizing neural networks with phase spaces. 

Only the developed method is explained herein. The code was written in MATLAB and can not be shared due to university regulations unfortunately :(
